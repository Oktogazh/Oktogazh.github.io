title: ICE-4005 - Meeting 18 Discovering torch-rnn

# Discussions
Reading the previously mentioned Karpathy article, I learned about the [char-rnn](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn) library, which could be dubbed the "Chat-GPT before transformers". There is also a torch-based implementation of the library, named [torch-rnn](https://github.com/jcjohnson/torch-rnn). We discussed using this library instead of remaking an implementation that could perform less well and I proposed focusing on the "user experience" by building a Jupyter notebook that would take the form of a tutorial on ho. Bill said it was ok to use a Jupyter notebook for a mini-project.

# Goal
For the next week, the goal is to familiarise my self with the Jupyter notebook ecosystem.
