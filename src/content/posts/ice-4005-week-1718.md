# Reading
I learned about [Andrej Karpathy's char-rnn](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn) which tries to predict the next character for natural texts. Although my model is supposed to train on dictionaries, not text, the idea is similar to mine in many ways. So I read [his blog post](https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) on the topic.
