## Meeting

**Attendance**: Alan, Bill

**Agenda**:
  - Present to bill create a lexical test aiming at counting the number of words in the mind of the testee using the Zipf law and a variation of the binary search algorithm.

**Actions**:
- **Alan**: Write a dummy python version of the test.

**Discussions**
- Alan presented the problematic and interest of vocabulary tests, pointing out that the ways current tests are subobtimal and how the use of pseudowords and a variation of the binary search algorithm could improve the way we count the number of words known by individuals. A granular evaluation of vocabulary knowledge would have applications in the following area: L2 research, psycholinguistics, cognitive psychology, AI (testing LLMs verbal abilities), placement testing (students, immigration) etc...
- Bill agreed with Alan's proposision.
- Bill mentioned that the distribution of the "point of failure" in such a lexical test should be a [negative biniomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_binomial_distribution) instead of a normal distribution as Alan thought.
