## Meeting aborted

The meeting was supposed to happen online as I was back in Brittany for the Christmas break.
But there must have been a mismatch in the understanding of the meeting time nobody showed up at the time the other was expecting.
Here is a summary of my activities since the last meeting.

## Writing and reading
I read a [comparison of different pseudo-word generating algorithm](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17470218231164373), and settled on one using Markov chains of orthographic n-gram, for its versatility and ease of implementation.

I wrote a [blog post](./elo-rating-and-rasch-model) about how the Elo rating system works and relates to the Rasch model.
As I was researching who else did this comparison between the two systems, I found the following article:

Pelánek, R. (2016) 'Applications of the Elo rating system in adaptive educational systems', _Computers & Education_, 98, pp. 169–179. Available at: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2016.03.017.

Here is a [short causual review](pelanek-2016) of the article.
