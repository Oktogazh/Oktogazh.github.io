An algorithm that is based on the assumption of [conflicting constraits](conflicting-constraints) from Optimality Theory. It creates weights for different character combinations and rates words by summing their constraints violations: "klutt" thus weights less likely than "polique" in the Engllish phonotactic grammar.
