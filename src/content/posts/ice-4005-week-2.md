## Meeting

**Attendance**: Alan, Bill

**Main discussion points**:
  - Discussing the Research Question: "How to integrate contradictory language rules in a spell checker? The case of the integration of Welsh in Language Tool." Bill said there is still time to refine it and that is was not as important as the nature of the project work is already clear. The RQ can be refined later.
  - Show the [website](https://oktogazh.github.io/) and explain the justification for this format (basically, enable Alan to publish his logs in Welsh for the MSc individual project and keep them readable for everyone thanks to in-browser translation tools)

**Actions**:
  - [Alan]: Start the Meaven project.
