1. We postulate that recognition is the first stage of a word aquisition and all usages of a word, understanding, production, are based on this inicitial ability to discriminate a word. Note that the process of word aquisition technically never really ends, as new meaning can enrich one's word understanding, but still, recognition is the one base of this aquisition process.
2. It thus make sense to measure vocabulary recognition skills for people learning a new language.
3. LDT based tests have been designed to test the correlation between recognition skills and overall profitiency with encouraging results. The LexTALE study showed the criterion validity, but no evidence support the idea that grammatical knowledge, good pronunciation, and other aspects of proficiency are always intertwined. If vocabulary growth is a normal prerequesite for developing these other aspects in a normal set up, we cannot make the assuption that this normal setup will always be the rule. Language learning programs exist that focus on teaching a maximum of conversational skills and grammar with a minimum emphasis on vocabulary. Conversally one could successfully learn lists of vocabulary without developping further profeciency. Most likely, this differences between skills tend to be errased as fluency increases, and this fact may be the reason explaining the concurent validity of the LexTALE study, which focus on advanced L2 speakers. In this study, although we acknoledge the eventual correlation at higher levels of proficiency, we won't aproach the test as anything else than a vocabulary test.
4. Taking Messick's ontological, epistemological and axiological framework, here is what we can state:
	1. On the ontological level. We state that vocabulary recognition skills measured by the test is a structural construt having a real link with other aspects of vocabulary mastery, understanding, production etc...
	2. On the epistemological level, we state that if no reading impairment or dyslexia affect the testees, then the test exatly reflect the testees' word recognition skills.
	3. On the axiological level, the need for measuring recogision stems from a will to incentivise vocabulary diversification, and the activities that allow it, reading, social interactions etc... But on the result interpretation level, it is not meant as a placement test but as a guide, a companion test that can inform on a crucial aspect of language aquisition by providing a simple metric. This metric's main goal being to rase attention or awareness on the people's own lexical development level in comparaision to others.
5. Other than that, these tests have one significant advantage over other testing paradigms, their minimalist setup allow them to be administered in less than five minutes, which make them a good candidate for recurant testing, on a weekly, or maybe daily basis that could help research in the dynamics of language aquisition.
6. One drawback is the fact that the tests designed so for far:
	1. rely on preliminary studies
	2. rely on short, handcrafted lists of words, which makes it difficult to conclude on the consistency of the results, essential constituent of a test's validity.
