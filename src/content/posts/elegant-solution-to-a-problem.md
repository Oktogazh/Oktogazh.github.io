> At any rate, Bruce Hayes (1989) can safely profess that he has accounted for many of the effects I claim to have accounted for. But I cannot accept his claim that virtually all significant distinctions in metre come straight out of processes in language, even if he can, eventually account for all the phenomena to be accounted for. After all, poetic rhythm is not merely a linguistic, but also an aesthetic phenomenon. To describe this aesthetic aspect I have used the formula "the elegant solution to a problem" (adopted from Dewey, Pepita, Haezrahi and Kris and Kaplan). Though Halle and Keyser did it for a different purpose, by determining the stress pattern and the linguistic pattern independently of each other, they providepowerful means for the instantiation of this performance.
