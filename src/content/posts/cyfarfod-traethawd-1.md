# 1. Demo of the testing interface
1. I made a small demo of the front end test to show the general behavior of the model.  

# 2. Shortcomings of the Research Proposal
1. The RP showed a confusion between different directions that the vocabulary test could take. The dissertation should be more focused on a single goal: describe the test and argue for its relevance in the literature revue.
2. The literature review was not researched enough. Little effort have been made to find relevant papers in the field of adptive testing, technology and AI in education, people like the ALTA group in Cambridge and the IAIED society and its journal and education in low resource languages (LRL).  

# 3. Priorities for Next Time
1. Leave the code aside to focus more on the litterature review and prepare the ethical application form.
2. Look up the literature to inform the ethical form.
