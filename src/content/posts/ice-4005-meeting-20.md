title: ICE-4005 - Meeting 20 Fetching dictionaries

# Discutions

I rebooted the "sudogen" repo that I created a couple of months ago to refactor everything in a collection of Jupyter notebook format. So far I focused on the fetching of Hunspell dictionary from Mozilla Firefox's dictionary list and extracting a lemmas list from it. I called this part of the projet "[Introduction](https://github.com/Oktogazh/sudogen/blob/master/1%20Introduction.ipynb)".
The goal for next week is to build and train a model able to generate pseudo-words from these list of lemmas we extracted.
