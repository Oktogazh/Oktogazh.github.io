# Chapter 1 (Carol A. Chapelle, validy)
- **intro**: exposing the dychotomy between SLA and language tesing, point out the need to come to an agrement on the validity of the "validators" that are the language test used.
- **goal**: introfuce the aspects of language testing validity that testers and SLA researcher broadly agree on, especially ones introduced by Messick (1989). Validity. In R. L. Linn (Ed.), Educational measurement, his idea being that several types of evidence contitute a gloablly valid type.
- **important concepts**: 
	- construt: "A meaningful interpretation, or explanation, of performance consistency", the underlying trait a test is designed to measure
	- construct meaning:  the part of the test score that relates to the construct
- Validitation is a continuous investigation on a test being used. The test seeks validation but the test must also be used in context to have its validity investigated.
- Consistency of the results is a prerequisite to validity investigation.
