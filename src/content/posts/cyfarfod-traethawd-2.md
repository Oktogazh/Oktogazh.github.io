[Previous Meeting](cyfarfod-traethawd-1) (Research Proposal Feedback)

# 1. Review of the Ethical Approval Form
1. As a "side quest", we discussed the possibility of adding a questionnaire at the end of a test to look for relevant questions to ask test takers and find correlations between their vocabulary levels and some language exposition features. Instead of inventing the questions, one should rely better established questionnaires like [LEAP Q](https://bilingualism.northwestern.edu/leapq/). However, we stressed that this was a side quest and somewhat unnecessary thing to add to the test, only if the rest is completed in time.
2. The files to add to the application: 
	1. Consent form ✅
	2. Participant Information Sheet ✅
3. About the open science practices, we discussed how to publish the test results on the [Open Science Fundation](https://osf.io/)
4. The previous discussion on disclosing the data led us to discuss anti-cheat preocupations, which is not a priority in the scope of the dissertation.

# 2. Priorities for the Next Meeting
1. Send the files mentioned in 1.2 to the ethical application form ASAP ✅ and sign the application form ❌
2. Build the core of the test in order to start collecting the data
3. Start writing the literature review of the dissertation
