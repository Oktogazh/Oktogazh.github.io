title: Elo Rating and Rasch Model
category: testing

### Context
When discussing with my spycholinguistic lecturer my test idea of using the Elo rating system to assess the difficulty items, alongside the testees themselves, she told me about the Rasch model. I never heard of it before, and a quick look seemed to indeed, look really similar to the idea.

The general concept is to predict the chances of having a given result based on the rating of an item and that of an examinee. Then, after the task ends, a score is given by substracting the expected result from the actual result. If 1 is expected and 1 (a successful completion of the task) occures, then the score is 0. If 0 is expected and 1 occures, then the score is one.
Ideally, we want challenges where there is a 50% chance of success, so that the ratings keep evolving towards their "intrinsic value". In chess, we select players with aproximatively the same rating, so that their chances of winning are equal. If one player win, when the expected score was 50%-50%, then one player will win by $1-0.5=0.5$ and the other will lose by $0-0.5=-0.5$.
Still in chess, this score is multiplied by a factor called a $K$ value, so that less matches have to be played to find out this intrasic level of the players. In the case of the Rasch model, the idea is the same, exept that half of the participents are a task to accomplish and those tasks are given the same rating as the test takers in a way that, if test takers find the solution for tasks that most player fail at, their rating will increase faster than if they find the right answer to simpler questions. No $K$ value in the Rasch model, but as we saw, it is not really needed neither.

"So, where is the difference?" askest thou. Behold, the end will surprise you!

Now that we know how the rating evolve based on the expected result, we need to figure out how this expected result is calculated...
