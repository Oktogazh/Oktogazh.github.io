Generative AI can produce a lot of data for different uses for minority languages: news, translation, education, testing etc...
Attempt have been made to use LLMs for testing purposes, in this work we present a different approach, generating the items, and using the Elo rating system sort the items by relative difficulty.
We test this general idea with a simple vocabulary test, largely used and studied in the litterature for English, but much less of other languages, let alone minority languages. This test is implemented for different languages, higher and lower resourced languages.
