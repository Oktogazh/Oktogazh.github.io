## Noteworthy commits

As I started the Welsh module for LT on a fork that I could not run `mvn clean install` on, I had to create a patch file of the commits that I made in this old fork (with `git format-patch`) and apply the patch on the fork from the updated repo (see previous post) with the `git am` command. This is why we can see three commits made at the same time [here](https://github.com/Oktogazh/languagetool/commits/master/?since=2024-11-04&until=2024-11-04)
