This review focuses on [this M.Sc. dissertation](../assets/outstanding-dissertation.pdf).  

Introduction (100 words):
- What is the main research question/hypothesis?  
Identifying whether the base language used to make speech-to-text model through transfer learning influences the quality of the models and if yes, to which extent and what are the main elements influencing the quality of a model in general.
- Why is this research significant in its field?  
This research closes several gaps in the litterature on learning transfer for speech to text model generation. It is especially relevant for lower resources languages like Welsh and Breton, which have to rely on smaller datasets for their training. An optimisation of the learning transfer technic would allow the technology, and its derivating integrations to be extended to more languages, which is significant for the field, but also for those linguistic communities.
